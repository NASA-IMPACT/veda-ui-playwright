    "FirstBodyParagraph":"Images of Earth at night give us an extraordinary view of human activity over time. The nighttime environment illuminates Earth features, including city infrastructure, lightning flashes, fishing boats navigating open water, gas flares, aurora, and natural hazards, such as lava flowing from an active volcano. Paired with the moonlight, researchers can also spot snow and ice, as well as other reflective surfaces that allow nighttime land and ocean analysis.",

    "ThirdBodyParagraph":"Nightlights data are collected by the Visible Infrared Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Day/Night Band (DNB) on the Suomi-National Polar-Orbiting Partnership (Suomi-NPP) platform, a joint National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and NASA satellite. The images are produced by NASA’s Black Marble products suite. All data are calibrated daily, corrected, and validated with ground measurements for science-ready analysis.",
    "FourthBodyParagraph":"New research funded by NASA’s Rapid Response and Novel Research in the Earth Sciences (RRNES) program seeks to discover what nightlights can tell us about the impacts of novel coronavirus-related shutdowns.",

    "FifthBodyParagraph":"Each spotlight city has a slider for turning night lights on and off. The darker purple indicates fewer night lights, while the lighter yellow indicates more. By comparing regions before and after guidelines to shelter-in-place began, researchers are able to visualize the extent to which social distancing measures affected various economic activities based on whether light pollution increased or decreased, which highways were shut down, and which cities stayed the same.",
    "SixthBodyParagraph":"The products featured are 500-meter (VNP46) and 30-meter Black Marble High Definition (HD) nighttime lights. Black Marble HD downscales radiances from the 500-meter product to street level using optical imagery from Landsat 8, a NASA and U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) satellite, along with OpenStreetMap ancillary layers. This helps visualize neighborhoods and commercial centers that have less activity – or closures – due to social distancing restrictions.",
